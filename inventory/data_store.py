product_attributes = {
	"Form Factor": "The form factor refers to the physical size, shape, and layout of a hardware component or device. In the context of computer components, such as motherboards or expansion cards, form factor determines the specific dimensions and mounting configurations that are compatible with a particular system or standard. It ensures that components can be properly installed and fit within the designated spaces of the system case or chassis. Common form factors include ATX, microATX, Mini-ITX for motherboards, and PCIe for expansion cards. Choosing the appropriate form factor is essential for compatibility and efficient use of hardware within a computer system.",
	"Hard Disk": "The hard disk description provides information about the physical attributes and specifications of the device's storage component. It includes details such as the storage capacity, interface type (e.g., SATA or NVMe), rotational speed (e.g., 5400 RPM or 7200 RPM), and form factor (e.g., 2.5-inch or M.2). This information helps users understand the storage capabilities and performance of the device, allowing them to determine its suitability for their needs.",
	"CPU Speed": "The CPU speed refers to the clock frequency at which the device's central processing unit (CPU) operates. It is measured in hertz (Hz) and represents the number of instructions the CPU can execute per second. A higher CPU speed generally indicates faster processing performance, allowing for quicker execution of tasks and improved overall system responsiveness. The CPU speed is a crucial factor to consider when evaluating the device's performance capabilities, especially for demanding applications such as gaming, video editing, and computational tasks.",
	"Graphics Coprocessor": "The graphics coprocessor, also known as the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), is a specialized component responsible for rendering and displaying visual content on the device's screen. It works in conjunction with the CPU to handle graphics-intensive tasks, including gaming, multimedia playback, and graphics editing. The graphics coprocessor enhances the device's visual capabilities, enabling smooth and realistic graphics rendering. Its specifications, such as the model, memory capacity, and processing power, provide insights into the device's graphics performance and determine its ability to handle graphically demanding applications.",
	"Graphics Card": "The graphics card description provides detailed information about the device's dedicated graphics card, if applicable. A dedicated graphics card, separate from the integrated graphics typically found in CPUs, offers enhanced graphical performance and is particularly important for gaming, 3D modeling, and other graphics-intensive tasks. The description may include the model, memory capacity, type of memory (e.g., GDDR6), clock speed, and other relevant specifications. This information allows users to assess the device's graphical capabilities and determine its suitability for their specific needs.",
	"CPU Model": "The CPU model refers to the specific type and model of the device's central processing unit (CPU). It provides information about the manufacturer, architecture, number of cores, and other relevant specifications. The CPU is the brain of the device, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. The CPU model influences the device's overall performance, power efficiency, and multitasking capabilities. Users can use the CPU model information to gauge the device's processing power and compatibility with software requirements, ensuring it meets their desired performance standards.",
	"Package Dimension": "The package dimension refers to the physical size and dimensions of the package in which the items are contained. It represents the measurements of the package, including length, width, and height, and is typically used to determine the size of the package for shipping, storage, and compatibility with accessories or carrying cases. The package dimension ensures that the item(s) are packaged securely and efficiently, while also considering convenience and portability for the end user.",
	"Display Size": "This refers to the physical dimensions of the gadget's screen, measured diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner. The display size determines the overall size of the gadget and influences the visual experience. A larger display size offers more screen real estate, making it ideal for activities like multimedia consumption, gaming, and productivity tasks. On the other hand, a smaller display size may result in a more compact and portable gadget, suitable for one-handed use and easy storage. The choice of display size depends on personal preferences and the intended usage of the gadget.",
	"Network Technology": "The gadget supports advanced network technologies such as 4G LTE and, in some models, 5G. With 4G LTE, you can enjoy fast data transfer speeds for quick web browsing and app downloads. 5G capabilities provide even faster speeds, lower latency, and improved responsiveness for a more immersive mobile experience. The gadget also supports Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth for wireless device connections, and NFC for contactless communication with compatible devices and services.",
	"Screen Resolution": "The gadget features a high-resolution display that showcases vibrant colors and sharp details. The screen utilizes advanced technology to provide excellent contrast, deep blacks, and wide viewing angles, offering an immersive visual experience.",
	"Connectivity": "The gadget supports fast and reliable connectivity options, including 4G LTE and Wi-Fi, ensuring you stay connected wherever you are. It also seamlessly integrates with other devices, making it easy to share content, make calls, and send messages across different platforms.",
	"Battery Life": "The gadget is designed to provide long-lasting battery life, allowing you to stay connected throughout the day. Whether you're browsing the web, streaming media, or using power-intensive apps, the device optimizes power consumption to ensure you can rely on it for extended periods without needing to recharge.",
	"Operating System": "The gadget operates on a user-friendly and intuitive operating system. This operating system offers a seamless and consistent user experience across various devices and provides access to a wide range of apps, games, and services. Regular updates are released for the operating system, ensuring you have access to the latest features and security enhancements.",
